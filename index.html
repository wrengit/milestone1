                            We had decided to do the whole thing ourselves, but after a few weeks of scrap-booking, I felt like my fiancé was going to kill me! We got in contact with ruhstik. and they took over from there. They delivered everything we asked for...and more!

                                  When Sally and Mike came to us, they had already been in contact with a handful of more traditional wedding planners.
                                  <br>
                                  Their experience so far had been stressful, and none of the other providers had been keen to stray too far from the regular experience. They gave a call and we quickly became just as excited to take on their requests, as they were to realise them.
                                  <br>
                                  <br>
                                  Turns out Mike had always dreamed of tying the knot with his future wife in a forest. Not satisfied with a small gathering under a couple of trees, we secured an ancient woodland location within reasonable travelling distance.
                                  <br>
                                  After deciding on the venue, Sally proposed that all the guests could stay on site, but she wasn't sure how that might work (no one wants to be putting on a suit in a dingy tent!).
                                  <br>
                                  <br>
                                  We put the team to work and they delivered!
                                  <br>
                                  A local craftsman produced authentic Gypsy Caravans, and we negotiated hiring his entire display catalogue to put of the guests.
                                  A perfect clearing was found in the forest, solar lighting and portable compost toilets were brought in, and the whole area was decorated with suggestions from the couple’s scrapbook.
                                  <br>
                                  <br>
                                  The big day arrived and ruhstik. took care of all the details, with a (discreet!) on-site coordinator on hand to ensure everything ran smoothly.
                                  <br>
                                  <br>
                                  Success!

                                  They started their relationship furiously debating the moral implications of burning a city, how little finger got his name, and how the size of Westeros seemed to change with each episode. They hit it off and decided to meet.
                                  <br>
                                  Within three months they were engaged. Now you can imagine they wanted to celebrate this unique day with a something a little less ordinary.
                                  <br>
                                  <br>
                                  We were tasked with finding a castle and ensuring that all the guests had access to authentic Westerosi dress! A feast was required, along with a Maester to perform the ceremony. This was certainly one of the more interesting requests to work on and goes to show that you give us a brief, and we will make it happen.

                                  Falling from the sky with nothing more than a nylon sheet to slow your decent. This was Sarah and Jason’s passion and they wanted us to incorporate it into their celebrations.
                                  <br>
                                  They wanted a traditional affair, with a large ruined abbey chosen as the venue.
                                  <br>
                                  Sarah and Jason took it upon themselves to organise much of the planning, enjoying getting stuck in and making decisions. They asked us to provide the place...and the entrance.
                                  <br>

                                  The guests were all summoned to the abbey, a little confused the groom was nowhere to be seen. Our on-site coordinator suggested that the guests look to the sky, as two small aircraft flew parallel to each other approaching the site.
                                  <br>
                                  As they flew overheard the bride and groom, dressed in flowing white gown, coat and tails, lept from their respective planes, and descended towards the abbey, opening their 'shoots close to the ground for a spectacular entrance.

                                  Apart from some slightly ruffled hair (both the happy couple, and the more traditional guests!), they looked fantastic.

                                  Simon and Will came to us as recommended by some of their friends.
                                  <br>
                                  They had attended the wedding of Wendy and Paul and where so impressed with the authenticity of the day, and the attention to detail that they knew they wanted to work with rushtik.
                                  <br>
                                  <br>
                                  Will was a traditionalist, and wanted a large church wedding, with all the trimmings. They were also both very busy with the professional life and had next to no time to wort any of the details.
                                  <br>
                                  We discussed at length what they wanted, and our team then got to work finding the perfect venue and organising every detail of their day.
                                  <br>
                                  Invitations and a bespoke website for the day were made, a catering team brought in to serve the best local cuisine, and the after party set up with guests request tracks from the invitations site.
                                  <br>
                                  We also provided speech writers to Simon and Will, to assist in that all-important Grooms speech.
                                  <br>
                                  <br>
                                  A traditional British wedding completely managed from start to finish to make Simon and Will's day the most enjoyable it could be.
